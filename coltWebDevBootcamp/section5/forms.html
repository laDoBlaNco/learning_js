    <h1>Forms Demo</h1>
    <!-- the form element is just a wrapper element, it doesn't actually do anything on the page. Though its
    attr do decide the action and method of pushing data to the server as the request -->

    <!-- A button outside of the form doesn't submit -->
    <button>Outside of Form (DOES NOTHING)</button>

    <form action="/tacos">

        <!-- <input> - the input element is used to create a varient of differnt form controls
                We have 20+ possible types of inputs ranging from date pickers to checkboxes
                The 'type' attr is where the magic happens. Changing type dramatically alters
                the input's behavior and appearance. it also doesn't have a closing tag.  
                -->
        <!-- If you create a button and don't explicitly tell it what to do, it'll submit the form
        by default -->
        <!-- Now if we add a type attr and tell it to behave like a button, it won't submit -->
        <button type="button">PLEASE DO NOT SUBMIT THE FORM</button>
        <p>
            <label for="username">Enter a username</label>
            <input type="text" placeholder="username" id="username" name="username">
        </p>
        <p>
            <label for="password">password</label>
            <input type="password" placeholder="enter your password" id="password" name="password">
        </p>
        <BUTTON>IN THE MIDDLE</BUTTON>
        <p>
            <label for="color">Enter a Color</label>
            <input type="color" id="color" name="color">
        </p>
        <p>
            <label for="number">enter a Number</label>
            <input type="number" placeholder="enter a number" id="number" name="num" min="1" max="1000">
        </p>
        <!-- Labels are super important though people don't feel they are. they are important for
        accessibility and even grouping. The label is typically also clickable. 
        Super important that we follow this pattern, especially if its for a portfolio or released
        to the world. We can also nest the input in the label and then not need to use the 'for' and
        the 'id'. But its not a common approach.-->

        <!-- Buttons are super common and important. We have buttons all over our web apps. There are
        even buttons that aren't really buttons, but links disguised as buttons with CSS -->
        <button>Submit</button> <!-- Note tht when we click a button it takes us to our 'action' '/tacos'-->
        <!-- you can also use an input with type submit. But its not common and semantically its not
        really correct. Inputs should take input, not just a push  -->
        <input type="button" value="Click Me">

        <!-- A very important attr for forms is 'name'. Apparently when we submit to a form its the 'name' attr
        that tells the server where its coming from. When we see for example in the url after a search:
        reddit.com/search/?q=something
        That 'q' is the name of the input. I've added a 'name' to the username input above to see the result 
        http://localhost:3000/tacos?username=chickenman, or 
        http://localhost:3000/tacos?username=ladoblanco&password=some_password&color=%23b62525&num=69
        so its used on pretty much all forms that are submitted
        its easy to use and we'll see it all over the place. For now we are sending all of our data in the url
        which can be problematic, but we'll find a better to do this later.  -->
    </form>

    <!-- so using the form action attribute we can actually send our queries to other pages if we use the
    correct url format including the name attr on our input needs to match. Below we are using for reddit. -->
    <h2>Hi-Jacking Searches</h2>
    <h3>Search Reddit</h3>
    <form action="https://www.reddit.com/search">
        <input type="text" name="q">

    <h3>Search Google</h3>
    <form action="https://www.google.com/search">
        <input type="text" name="q">

    <h3>Search YouTube</h3>
    <form action="https://www.youtube.com/results">
        <input type="text" name="search_query">
        <button>Search YouTube</button>
    </form>
    <!-- Interestingly, we don't have to have a button to submit. If we have an input and our form as an action
    then if we enter  info in the input and hit enter it'll be submitted the same way.-->

            <!-- Remember that a radio button is like a checkbox. The GET request will simply say 'on' or be blank
            So if we submit all we will see is the name and 'on', but we won't know which button was clicked
            unless we use another attr which is 'value'. Its not displayed to the user, but its what gets submitted
            to the server. http://127.0.0.1:3000/birds?agree_tos=on&size=m -->
