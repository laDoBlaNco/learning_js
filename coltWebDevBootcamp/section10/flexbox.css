/* 
The Basics:
Flex-box is a one-dimensional layout method for laying out items in rows
and columns. 
Its new(ish) - its a recent addition to CSS, included to address common layout frustrations
Why? It allows us to distribute space dynamically across elements of an unknown size, hence  the term
"flex", within a "container". Creating flexible layouts. 

Terminology: in Flexbox when we turn it on there are two axis. 
Main axis goes from left to right. 

Flexbox has about 8-10 properties that work together. they are: 


display:flex - basically turning on flexbox
flex-direction:row - with this we can change our main axis direction
justify-content - determines how the elements are distributed across the main access
                  so its behavior is total dependent on the flex-direction
flex-wrap - uses 'wrap' and 'wrap-reverse' and just determins if the elements wrap when they hit the
            edges, or if they are squashed to fit. wrap and wrap-reverse take into consideration the 'cross-axis'
