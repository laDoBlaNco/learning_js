        <!-- Remeber that we shouldn't use headings for their size. We have to write HTML semantically meaning 
we use h1, h2, h3, etc for their 'level' of importance in the document. I could easily change size and 
appearance with CSS. Also we should have only ONE h1 at most. If we are doing this semantically we can't have
2 top level headings. -->

    in css for this-->

        <!-- Another souple of elements we won't use much is the break. Again something we would semantically 
        use css for, but I might see it in some sites (<sup> and <sub> as I've put below in the parrs)-->

        <p>The <b>chicken</b> (Gallus domesticus) is a domesticated species that arose from the <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_junglefowl">red
                junglefowl</a>,
            originally
            from
            India.
            They have also partially hybridized with other wild species of junglefowl (the grey junglefowl, Ceylon
            junglefowl,
            and
            green junglefowl).[1] Rooster and cock are terms for adult male birds, and a younger male may be called a
            cockerel.
            A
            male that has been castrated is a capon. An adult female bird is called a hen, and a sexually immature
            female is
            called
            a pullet. Humans keep chickens primarily as a source of food (consuming both their meat and eggs) or as
            pets.
            Traditionally, they were also bred for cockfighting, which is still practiced in some places. Chickens
            domesticated
            for
            meat are broilers, and for eggs, they are layers.</p>



        <p>Chickens are one of the most common and widespread domestic animals, with a total population of 23.7 billion
            as
            of
            2018,<sup><a href="somesource.com">[2]</a></sup> up from more than 19 billion in 2011. There are more
            chickens
            in the
            world
            than any other bird.
            There
            are
            numerous cultural references to chickensâ€”in myth, folklore, and religion, as well as in language and
            literature.

        <!-- HTML Entities are a code or a combination of chars that results in whole different character
        - Start with an ampersand and end with a semicolon. So these aren't part of the code but how
          they are delimited with & and ;
        - Used to display reserved characters, that normally would be invalid (for example in the url of
          a browser or the < and > symbols as seen below)
        - Also used in place of difficult to type characters (such as a diamond or copyright symbol, cross or an
          arrow, etc)
        - The browser interprets them and renders the correct character instead.  -->

        <h1>1 &lt; 6 &amp; &spades; &clubs; &hearts; &diam;</h1>


        <!-- While some browsers like chrome will display it OK, it will cause problems later which is 
            why vscode screams. another one is the same &, most entities also  (or only) have numbers such as #9824, but
            its easier when we can use a common name like 'spades' or 'amp'-->

        <!-- The meaning of semantic is the purpose or role of HTML. Semantic markup is relatively new in HTML
    world and mainyly used for screen readers and accesibility tools (the blind homies). It addresses
    MEANINGLESS MARKUP. Most web devs just used divs all over the place. So there are other elements that do
    the same thing for us as a div, but with different names that give our HTML "meaning". Another reason
    is that it makes our code  more "crawlable" or "friendly" to other applications or other code. and finally
    it makes the code more navegable for ourselves and other devs. I've added some in this page such as:
    <section> = represents a standalone section -- which doesn't have a more specific semantic element to
        represent it -- contained within HTML document. Typically, but not always, sections have a heading.
        Its a generic element.
    <article> = represents a self-contained composition in a document, page, application, or site, which is
        intended to be independently distributable or reusable. There should be a header telling us what the
        article is about.
    <nav> = used with anything on the page that provides navigation links
    <main> = used for content that is not repeated across pages like sidebars, links, etc, but rather  for things
        that are unique to the document. Its the principle part of the page. 
    <header> = represents introductory content, typically a group of introductory or navigational aids. It 
        may contain some heading elements but also a logo, a search form, an author name, and other elements such
        as the navigational bar, etc. As mentioned they can also go inside of other elements such as an 
        article. So we can have more than one on a page. 
    <footer> = Same as a header but focused on the end of the page or section with author, copyright information,
        or nav bars to related documents, etc. 
    <aside> = represents a portion of a document whose  content is only indirectly related to the document's
        main content. Asides are frequently presented as sidebars or call-out boxes.
    <figure> = represents a self-contained content, potentially with an optional caption, which is specified
        using the <figcaption> element. The figure, its caption, and its contents are referenced as a single
        unit.
    <time> = represents a speific period in time. It may include the 'datetime' attribute to translate dates
        into machine-readable format, allowing for better search engine results or custom features such as
        reminders 
    <abbreviation> = represents an abbreviation or acronym; the optional title attr can provide an expansion
        or description for the abbr. If present, title must contain this full description and nothing else.
    <data> = links a given content with a machine-readable translation. If the content is time- or date-related,
        the <time> element should be used.
