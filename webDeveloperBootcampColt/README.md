# WEB DEVELOPER BOOTCAMP

This repository is dedicated to the more  comprehensive course I've found
on Udemy (or anywhere) regarding getting up to speed to becoming a professional
web dev. Colt is also an outstanding teacher with great teaching style. 

As I focus on becoming a Go expert, I want to make sure that I don't lose what
I've already developed in my frontend studies, so this will be an excellent
way to even break into what I really want to do as a career.
