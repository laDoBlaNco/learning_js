  <!-- Internal CSS:
  Advantages: separate content and presentation. Easy to use, in particular if you want to apply the same
              style to all tags of a certain element type. Its  easier to do it with internal CSS than inline CSS
              Its also good if we have limited amounts of CSS in the page.
 Disadvantages: Hard to manage for large, complex pages and we can't reuse for other pages without copying and pasting 
                it in every page header.

  <style>
    #internal {
      color: blue;
      text-transform: capitalize;
    }
  </style>
  <!-- This is how we link external CSS -->
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="move-styles.css">
</head>

<body>
  <!-- 
When using CSS we can put it in our document in 3 ways:
inline - means we add it as an attribute directly to the element tag
internal - means we embed a 'style' tag in our html 'head' tag and use the CSS there
external - meaning that we create a separate '.css' file and using a 'link' tag in our header to connect the files


   -->

  <!-- Inline: 
  Inline CSS is easy to use and good and quick for one-off situations. It is hard to manage though for
  large, complex pages, and we are mixing content and presentation which should be avoided.-->
