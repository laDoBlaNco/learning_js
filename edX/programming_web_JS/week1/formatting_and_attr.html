  <!-- Some of the core attributes are 
  title - which gives a suggest title to an element (not the title of the page) and when you over
          over the element a tooltip will appear with that title
  style - used to change the visual presentation of an element using 'key:value' pairs (remember 
          what we lerned from Colt. Inline styles have very specificity and shouldn't be used in production.)
  We also have 'id' and 'class' attributes in order to uniquely identify elements in HTML. This way can style
  many elements at the same time and adjust them accordingly without having to go through them 1 at a time.
  id - provides ability to refer to specific element; id must be unique
  class - provides ability to refer to a subgroup of elements within html doc; it doesn't have to be unique
