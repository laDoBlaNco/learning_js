    // Without getting too deep in OOP in JS its worth knowing the following up front:
    //  - Every object in JS has a 'prototype', accessec from the __proto__ property in the object.
    //  - The __proto__ property is also an object, with its own __proto__ property, and so on
    //  - The root prototype of all objects is 'Object.prototype'
    //  - An object inherits the properties of its prototype

    // Creating a Prototype - This is like a Class definition, but its not. Class defs came later in the language
    //  - Prototypes are created like any other JS function or object
    //  - The 'this' keyword refers to the current object
    //  - The new keyword can be used to create new objects from the same prototype
    function Person(name, age) {  // this is a prototype. We create it like a class but use 'function' instead of 'class'
      this.name = name;
      this.age = age;
      this.greeting = function () {
        return 'Hello! My name is ' + this.name;
      }

    // Let me step into a quick explanation of the difference between prototypes and Classes in JS    //
    ////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
    /**
     * We first need to understand the terms Prototype and Class and how they relate to JS.
     *  -Prototypes: JS is a prototypal based language, which means that it uses prototypes to inherit properties and
     *   methods from one object to another. In JS, objects can be linked to other objects, forming a prototype chain.
     *   When a property or method is accessed on an object, the JS engine first checks if that property or method exists
     *   on the object itself. If it doesn't, it will check the object's prototype, and so on, until it reaches the end
     *   of the prototype chain. If the property or method is not found, it will return undefined.
     * 
     * The example below illustrates the basic idea behind prototypes in JS, which is to provide a mechanism for objs
     * to inherit properties and methods from other objects in a chain-like fashion.
     */
    // Example of a prototype in JS (same as above really):
    let person = {
      name: "Unknown",
      sayHello: function () {
        console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name}`);
      }
    }
    let john = Object.create(person);
    john.name = 'John';
    let jane = Object.create(person);
    jane.name = 'Jane';
    john.sayHello();
    jane.sayHello();


    /**
     * Classes: Starting from ES6, JS has the class keyword, which provides a more traditional class-based way of creating
     * objects and their methods. Classes in JS are essentially SYNTACTIC sugar over the prototype-based system. In other
     * words, the class keyword provides a more familiar and clean syntax for creating objects and their methods, but 
     * under the hood, it still uses prototypes to link objects and inherit properties and methods. 
     * 
     * As we see below, the class Person has a constructor method that sets the properties. We create new objects with
     * 'new' which calls the constructor automatically. The main difference between prototypes and classes in JS is the
     * syntax really and the way they are used to create and organize objects and their methods. 
     */
    class Person2 {
      constructor(name) {
        this.name = name;
      }
      sayHello() {
        console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name}`);
      }
    }
    let kevin = new Person2('Kevin');
    let oda = new Person2('Odalis');
    kevin.sayHello();
    oda.sayHello();

    /**
     * 
     * So what are their uses? They are useful for creating objects with similar properties and methods. Classes
     * provide a way to define a blueprint for an object and prototypes allow for inheritance.
     * 
     * Creating objects with similar properites and methods: Classes provide a way to define a blueprint for an obj.
     * This is useful for creating multiple instances of an object, such as multiple instances of a car or a person, 
     * all of which have the same properties (make, model, year) and methods(start,drive,stop).
     * 
     * Inheritance: Prototypes allow for inheritance so that objects can inherit properties and methods from their
     * parent object. This is useful for creating a hierarchy of objects, where a parent object defines common properties
     * and methods that are shared by all of its child objects. For example, an animal object could be the parent object
     * with properties like 'name' and 'age and methods like 'eat', 'sleep', and 'move'. You can create a child object
     * like dog, cat, or lion which can inherit properties and methods from the animal object so it can share
     * characteristics.
     * 
     * Code reusability: An important aspect of classes and prototypes in JS is code reusability. Classes and prototypes
     * allow for better organization and reuse of code, making it easier to create and maintain large and complex apps.
     * Creating objects with similar properties and methods, and inheriting properties and methods from parent objects, 
     * reduces the amount of duplicated code. This also makes it easier to add new features or make changes to existing
     * features. 
     * 
     * OOP: Classes and prototypes provide a way to implement object-oriented programming concepts in JS, which can
     * make the code readable and maintainable. Object-oriented programming concepts such as encapsulation, inheritance,
     * and polymorphism can be implemented using classes and prototypes, which makes it easier to understand and work
     * with the code, especially for developers who are familiar with object-oriented programming. 
     * 
     * Overall classes and prototypes provide a powerful and flexible way to create and organize objects in JavaScript
     * allowing better code reusability, organization, and maintainability. 
     * 
     * So...Which is better?
     * 
     * There is no concrete answer when it comes to choosing which of the two is better as one is just syntactic sugar
     * for the other and both implement different things for OOP. 
     * 
     * Prototypes in JS can be used to create objects and define their behavior, and are often considered
     * more flexible and less verbose. They allow you to add properties and methods to an object's prototype, which will
     * be inherited by all objects created from that prototype. Classes though are the more modern way of creating objects
     * and defining their behavior and are often considered more intuitive and easier to understand for developers familiar
     * with other object-oriented languages. They use syntax that is more commonly used in many other languages. 
     * 
     * If we are looking for a  more object-oriented approach to creating and managing objects, classes would be a better
     * selection. Classes provide a clear well-defined mechanism for inheritance and encapsulation. 
     * 
     * If we are looking to create many similar objects with slight variations, prototypes would be a better selection. 
     * Prototypes are usually more memory-efficient and faster than creating many classes. Additionally, prototypes are
     * useful in situations where you need to create objects that inherit from other objects, as JS prototype-based
     * inheritance system allows for easy inheritance and modification.
     * 
     * It's important to note that its possible to use both classes and prototypes in the same project, depending on the
     * specific needs of your project. For example, you could use classes to define a blueprint for creating objects
     * with a consistent set of methods and properties, and then use prototypes to create many similar objects with
     * slight variations. 
     * 
     * Conclusion:
     * Both prototypes and classes have their unique advantages and disadvantages, and the choice you make between
     * them depends on the specific requirement of your project. Classes provide a clear and well-defined mechanism
     * for inheritance and encapsulation, making them well-suited for creating a clear, structured hirearchy of objects
     * On the other hand prototypes are more memory-efficient and faster when creating many similar objects with slight
     * variations, and they allow for easy inheritance and modification of existing objects. Both classes and prototypes
     * can be used in the same project, depending on the specific needs of your project.
