    /**
     * JavaScript Basics
     * Like many other programming languages, JS includes:
     *  - variables, arrays, and objects
     *  - loops and conditional statements
     *  - functions
     *
     * Even if we know Java, remember that JavaScript isn't related. There are some big differences:
     *  - defining functions and objects
     *  - interacting with HTML
     */

    //  Declaring a variable with E5 (EcmaScript 5) which is the old JS. Most folks use E6 and after now with let and const
    //  - the basic syntax for declaring any JavaScript variable is 'var variableName = '
    var age = 22;
    var name = 'Jane Doe';
    var isMale = false;

    // Viewing a variable's value (1)
    // Using script tag in HTML or an external .js file, document.write(var) to display the value directly in the HTML
    document.write(age);
    // This way is of course discouraged as we are mixing functionality with structure in HTML

    // Viewing a varible's value (2)
    // We can use console.log(var) to print a variable's value in the browser's JS console.
    console.log(age);

    // viewing a variable's value (3)
    // using the alert(var) function to create a popup with the var's value that appears at the top of the browswer
    // alert(age);

    // Changing a variables type
    // - The type of each var doesn't need to specified and can be changed at any time in JS
    var id = 33.2; // first its a real or floating point
    id = 'secret' // not its a string

    // In JS there are 5 PRIMITIVE types: Number, String, Boolean, Null, Undefined
    /**
     * Numbers: 
     *  - All JS numbers are sorted using floating-point notation
     *    - Example integer 5 is stored internally as 0.5e1
     *  - +infinity represants all numbers greater than the constant Number.MAX_VALUE (around 10**308)
     *  - -infinity represents all numbers less than Number.MIN_VALUE (around 10**-324)
     *  - NaN represents any non-number value
     *    - Number('tree') would return 'NaN' 
     * 
     * Number Operations:
     *  - Basic arithmetic(+,-,*,/,%) can be used on JS numbers
     *  - Precedence will follow MDAS unless parenthses are used
     *  - ++ and -- can be used increment/decrement JS numbers
     */
    var a = 4;
    a++; console.log(a)
    var c = a - 3; console.log(c);
    var d = c + 3 * a; console.log(d);
    var e = (c + 3) * a; console.log(e);

    /**
     * Strings:
     *  - JS strings are series of  16-bit unsigned integers, each integer representing a char
     *  - Convention is to use single quotes for strings unless single quotes exist within the string.
     *    - 'I am a dolphin' vs "I'm a dolphin" 
     *  - Escape characters use backslash, which is pretty normal '\n \t \\'
     *  - All JavaScript strings are immutable:
     *    - Any manipulation results in a new string. 
     * 
     * Common String Functions:
     * + or .concat(otherString) can be used to concat strings
     * .toUpperCase and .toLowerCase to change the case. Remember that its a new string being returned
     *  and not mutating the original
     * .length gets the length of a string

    var firstName = 'John';
    var lastName = 'Doe';

    var fullName = firstName.concat(' ', lastName);
    console.log(fullName);
    var greeting = 'HELLO, ' + fullName;
    console.log(greeting);
    console.log(greeting.toUpperCase());
    console.log(greeting.toLowerCase());
    console.log(greeting.length);

    /**
     * Booleans:
     *  - Logical values that an only be true or false
     *  - Any value can be used as a boolean in JS
     *    - 'Falsy' values: null, undefined, 0, NaN, and ''
     *    - 'Truthy' values: just about everything else 
     *  - Any variable type can become a boolean when used with logical operators 
     *
     * Null:
     *  - a value that can be assigned to variables to represent 'no value'
     * Undefined:
     *  - a variable was declared but doesn't have a value assigned as of yet. 
     *    - if you try to use var that doesn't exist, under the hood that var is declared, but with a value
     *      of undefined.
