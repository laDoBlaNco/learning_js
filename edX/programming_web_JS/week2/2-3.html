    // Arrays;
    //    - Arrays are used to store a list of values in a single variable
    //    - Values can be of any type, and ar split with commas and wrapped in square brackets
    var myArray = ['cars', 12, false];
    var age = myArray[1];
    console.log(age);
    myArray[2] = true;
    console.log(myArray[2]);
    console.log(myArray.length);
    // good to note that if we try to get an item from an array thats out of bound (negative or higher than the length) then we 
    // get 'undefined' rather than an out of bounds error as we would in most langs.
    console.log(myArray[-9]);
    console.log(myArray[4]);

    // Another quirk is when adding things to arrays. If you add something out of bounds, it will be added and accessible
    // even if it doesn't fall in the correct series
    var a = ['cat', 'dog', 'banana'];
    a[4] = 'panda';
    console.log(a[4]);
    console.log(a[3]);
    a[-5] = 'elephant';
    console.log(a[-5]);
    console.log(a);
    // the main rule being if the index is >= arrayVar.length, it gets added
    // if its index < 0 then a special mapping is created and placed as an element in the array as well.

    // so to add or remove from an array we use .push/.unshift or .pop/.shift
    // The names shift and unshift intuitively tell us what's happening wth the underlying array from a Big O perspective. when dealing with
    // things on the front of the array we need to shift ever single element to the right or left. 
    var myArray = ['car', 'bike'];
    console.log(myArray);
    myArray.push('scooter');
    console.log(myArray);
    myArray.unshift('train');
    console.log(myArray);

    var vehicle = myArray.pop()
    console.log(vehicle);
    console.log(myArray);
    vehicle = myArray.shift();
    console.log(vehicle);
    console.log(myArray);


    // Objects:
    // JavaScript objects are used to store key-value pairs
    // Values can be of any type, including arrays or objects themselves.
    // We consider the values of an abject as properties and use both array and dot notation
    var person = {
      name: 'John Doe',
      age: 25,
      isMale: true,
      personality: ['patient', 'loyal', 'happy'],
      company: { name: 'edX', id: 2984 },
    }
    // though it looks like it, we keep in mind that this isn't a Class. Its an object. 
    console.log(person.age);
    console.log(person['company'].id);

    // as opposed to normal OOP where you can't really add properties to a class after its  init'd
    // these are objects, so we can do so, with no issues
    var pet = {
      name: 'Cooper',
      type: 'dog',
    }
    console.log(pet.age);
    pet.age = 11;
    console.log(pet.age);
    pet['status'] = 'good boy';
    console.log(pet.status);
    console.log(pet);
