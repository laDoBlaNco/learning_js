    so what is log? Just like Multiplication and Division are opposites, Logarithm and exponentiation are
    opposites.

    log 2 (value) = exponent is the same as 2 ^exponent = value
    Again since this is Big O, we don't really care about the 2, 3, 10, etc. Its just the Log that
    we care about. That's why we don't look at log2, etc in big O

    The logarithm of a number roughly measures the number of times you can divide that number by 2
    before you get a value that's less than or equal to one.

    log time complexity it great! Its just above O(1) and some argue that its even better than O(1) 

    1. Certain searching algos have log time complexity. (Time complexity)
    2. Efficient sorting algorithms involve logarithms (Time complexity)
    3. Recursion sometimes involves logarithmic space complexity (Space complexity) 


    RECAP:
    1. To analyze the performance of an algorithm, we use Big O Notation
    2. Big O Notation can give us a high level understanding of the time or space complexity of an algo
    3. Big O Notation doesn't care about precision, only about general trends (linear? quadratic? constant?)
    4. The time or space complexity (as measured by Big O) depends only on the algorithm, not the hardware
       used to run the algorithm
    5. Big O Notation is EVERYWHERE, so get lots of practice!
