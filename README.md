#LEARNING JAVASCRIPT

In my studies and focus on moving into a professional software developer and
indie hacker on the side, I've determined that I want to focus on the Google 
invested future with Go, Dart, and Flutter. But there is and will always be 
a necessity to be able to read and debug the all ubiquitous JavaScript along with
its partners in crime (HTML and CSS).

This repository is devoted to that path as I become an expert in
- Go
- Dart
- Flutter
- JavaScript
