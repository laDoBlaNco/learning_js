#LEARNING JAVASCRIPT

In my studies and focus on moving into a professional software developer role and
indie hacker on the side, I've determined that I want to focus on the Google 
invested future with Go, Dart, and Flutter for my long game. But there is and will always be 
a necessity to be able to read and debug the all ubiquitous JavaScript along with
its partners in crime (HTML and CSS). In fact, JS and TS remain one of the top programming
languages for a reason and are therefore worth my time. I've focused a bit on JS, TS, Node, etc and have awoken my UNDYING PASSION for all things JS!!!!

There's nothing you can't do with JavaScript. Maybe things you shouldn't do, but nothing you can't do.
