  <!-- So what is a px (pixel). They are super tiny units similar to a cm or in. On the screen we 
  would magnify and see these tiny units. Each unit has 3 lights (red, green, and blue) If they are
  all on then we will see white. If they are all off we will see black. Then of course the combinations
  of them will make different colors. -->

    Hi everyone, and welcome to a webpage I created. Actually...this is not my real web page. You can find that one 
    <a href='https://www.radufromfinland.com'> HERE</a>
  </p>
  <p id='p2'>
    This page is just to teach you how to make a very simple web page with some text, a link, an image, a button
    and a CANVAS.
